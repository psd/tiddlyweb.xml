Exchange TiddlyWeb resources using the XML representation.

XML is returned following a request for the text/xml and application/xml media types,
or by appending a .xml suffix before the query portion of a TiddlyWeb URI.

Resources may be created and modified by sending XML to a TiddlyWeb
recipe, bag or tiddler URI using an XML media type.

To use this code install the package and and add 'tiddlywebplugins.xml'
to system_plugins in the tiddlywebconfig.py of your TiddlyWeb instance:

config = {
    'system_plugins': ['tiddlywebplugins.xml'],
}
